When it comes to cold email success, your domain names matter more than you might think. They're among the first things email providers and recipients use to judge whether you're a trustworthy sender. While domain setup is just one piece of a [successful cold email strategy](/docs), it's often the make-or-break factor in whether your emails reach the inbox at all.

<Tip> **The Golden Rule of Domain Selection:** If you want to be treated like a trusted sender, act like one. This starts with choosing the right domain extensions (TLDs).</Tip>

# Which Domain Extensions Work Best?
The hierarchy is clear:
.com - The gold standard for trust and deliverability
.co - A strong second choice
Everything else (.io, .net, etc.) typically sees lower deliverability rates and trust scores. While these other extensions might be trendy, they're not ideal for cold email campaigns.

# Domain Naming Best Practices
Creating your domains isn't just about picking available names. Here are the key principles to follow:
Keep it simple and meaningful. Your domains should make sense at first glance.
Avoid red flags. Skip numbers and dashes (-) in your domain names. They often appear in spam domains.
Less is more. Only add prefixes or suffixes if needed, not both. The simpler your domains, the better.

# Proven Domain Patterns to Consider
Here are some effective patterns you can use when building your domains. Remember, these are examples to inspire you, not an exhaustive list.
