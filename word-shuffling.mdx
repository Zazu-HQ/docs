Sending the exact same email hundreds (or thousands) of times triggers alarm bells for ESPs like Google. 

Enter Word Shuffling: a smart way to automatically vary the wording in each email.

Some platforms call this "spintaxing" or "liquid spintax," but we find that unnecessarily complex. 

Just add synonym alternatives inside your text, and Za-zu randomly picks a different one every time your message sends:

<img
  className=""
  src="/images/word-shuffling.gif"
  alt="Adding word shuffling alternatives to a greeting (Hey, Hi, Hello)"
/>

Even a few alternatives can generate hundreds of unique variations.

Use word shuffling for:
- Greetings: [Hey, Hi, Hello]
- Closings: [Thanks, Thank you, Best regards]
- Common phrases: [I'd love to, I'd be happy to, I'm interested in]

The key is that each recipient gets a slightly different email, which looks more natural to email providers.
