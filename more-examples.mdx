<Tip>Remember, though, that your email should be perfect for the person you are emailing, and that examples you see online might not reflect what will work for you.</Tip>

<Info>**Email context:** This campaign focused on emailing companies with feedback on a recent social posts, letting them know an idea we had based on their content, and asking if they'd like to have a quick chat about better social media management.</Info>

> Hey, [redacted_name]<br />
> Saw your post about relaunching the Partner Program and ended up going down the rabbit hole.
> <br /> Random, but one thing I’ve noticed is that partner programs often rise or fall on how consistently you can keep your partners engaged. And more posts more often do just that.
> <br/> Ya'll are posting about 3 times per week over the last few weeks. <br/> 
> Curious — if you had a way to spot what’s hot right now and turn it into posts faster (so you can keep that momentum up), would that be useful? That’s exactly what we’ve been building at [Social Champ](https://socialchamp.com).

<Info>**Email context:** Mailmodo to a Head of Growth at a mid‑market SaaS. Their emails send people to a web page and lose them. Mailmodo moves the form or scheduler into the email (AMP), so fewer steps and more completions. Goal: A/B it against the current email and book a 15‑min run‑through.</Info>

> [redacted_name] — quick one, I noticed [redacted_company_name] pushes email clicks to a web page.<br />
> [Mailmodo](https://mailmodo.com) lets people finish that flow inside the email. That typically triples conversions because there are fewer steps.<br />
> Want to A/B it against your current email this week? We’ll set up a quick POC. Keep the winner.<br />
> <br />Do you have 15 min next week to run through it?<br />
