There is only so much reading you can do about something like outbound until it’s time to get out there, get your hands dirty, and launch your dream campaigns. Now is the time. I hope you’ve found the information in this handbook useful. Write to me on the [Za-zu community forum](https://discord.gg/bCFBxjXtGs) if you have feedback, thoughts, or questions. I’d love to help to the extent that I can.

From here, the path is clear: set up the infrastructure. Write your emails. Find somewhere to send your emails from, like [Za-zu](https://za-zu.com)—the sequencer I’ve built for outbound at scale, dedicated to people like you. Then, of course, there is only one thing left to do: start sending.

### Did you find this playbook valuable?

Enter your email below and we'll let you know when we post pieces about cold outbound. We publish thoughtfully (you won't be getting multiple emails a week) and focus our writing on cold email tactics and insights.
