There is only so much reading you can do about something like outbound until it’s time to get out there, get your hands dirty, and launch your dream campaigns. Now is the time. I hope you’ve found the information in this handbook useful. 

From here, the path is clear: set up the infrastructure. Write your emails. Find somewhere to send your emails from, like [Za-zu](https://app.za-zu.com)—the sequencer I’ve built for outbound at scale, dedicated to people like you. Then, of course, there is only one thing left to do: start sending.

If you end up working with us, write to me on the our community forum or join our weekly office hours. If you have feedback, thoughts, or questions. I’d love to help to the extent that I can.
